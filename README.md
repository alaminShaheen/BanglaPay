## :european_castle: Architecture
This project is a monorepo where the frontend and backend code reside in the same repository. The Nextjs frontend communicates with the `Nodejs` backend. `Google Sheets` has been used as the backend and authentications is implemented using `Firebase Authentication`. The backend is deployed using Firebase functions, which is basically a serverless framework that lets us automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by HTTPS requests. The frontend is deployed using `Vercel hosting`.
